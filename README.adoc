= OSGi configuration mapper

This project goal is to handle complex OSGi configurations. Configuration options are defined in a single configuration
file (called configset) and configurations of OSGi components are instantiated based on (Freemarker) templates so
reusing the same values defined by the single configuration file could be used by multiple templates.

== How it works?

Bundles implementing services could hold configuration templates in a specific directory of JAR file. Tracker component
detects them and creates component instances via OSGi configuration admin service substituting template variables
(defined by configuration file named +configset-*.cfg+).

== Configuration options

Here is the list of base configuration options (of configsets):

|===
| Key | Name | Default | Description
| +templatePath+ | Template path | +/config-templates+ |
The template pathes monitored inside bundles
| +envPrefix+ | Environment prefix | (undefined) |
Environment prefix used to get environment variables. For example: When X_ prefix used X_PART1_PART2 env variabsle used
as part1Part2 context variable in templates.
| +variableScopePrecedence+ | Variable scope preference | +osgi,environment,system+ | Comma-separated list of
variable scope precedences (first: lowest, last: highest).
|===

Custom variables are also available in templates.

=== Including configuration in Karaf feature

TODO: aggregated-config + maven-resources-plugin + feature/configfile

== Template variables

Precedence of variable scopes is defined by +variableScopePrecedence+ configuration option (it is not overridable by
system property or OS environment variable). The following items can be used:

* *osgi*: OSGi configuration options (configset variables)
* *environment*: OS environment variables
* *system*: JVM command line arguments (+-D...+)

[NOTE]
====
Dot is not supported in Freemarker template variables so dot (.) is replaced with underscore (_).

== Extensions

A basic example is described above but creation of some components depends on *conditional expressions* in some cases.
Other components have to be instantiated using *factory PID* or *multiple instances* of a gives components are necessary.

An optional XML file (syntax is defined by <<src/main/resources/configuration_mapper_v1.xsd,XML schema>>) could be used
to override default instantiation settings. Read XML schema for details.
